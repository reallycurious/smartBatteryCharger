PIC12F1572 based Charger for 14.4V cordless drill

After building a 2 meter by 2 meter cupboard and fastening all screws by hand I decided that a cordless drill is needed. So I bought the most inexpensive one I found. This cordless drill came with a 18v 400ma rated power adapter and charger stand that consists of few simple passive components: A 2W 10 Ohm resistor, an 4007 diode, two 3mm leds and two smd 0805 resistors one 2 KOhm the other 100 Ohm. Oh and instructions to charge 3-5 hours: which resulted in a very hot battery. I feared that it might vent electrolyte so I decided to replace electronics in charger stand, making it smarter.
